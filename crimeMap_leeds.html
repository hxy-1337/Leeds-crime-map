      <h2>Why this map is important for leeds</h2>
      <p>
        This map illustrates the spatial distribution of various crime types
        across the city of Leeds. Apart from identifying the exact locations
        where this type of crime occurred during the given month, We can also
        use the existing coordinates to generate separate heatmaps for different
        types of crimes, allowing us to further understand the crime rate of
        each specific type within smaller areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        This map helps improve public safety by showing crime hotspots. Itâ€™s
        especially useful for women and others to choose safer routes and avoid
        high-risk areas. For the police, this map helps deploy officers more
        effectively and ensures community safety by identifying areas with
        higher crime rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a socio-economic perspective, this map provides insights into
        whether a region is poor, as crime rates are often correlated with
        poverty. Furthermore, from an urban planning standpoint, the map could
        visualize crime data in past years or months, which could provide
        valuable feedback for city designers. It helps designers identify areas
        where certain building or space designs may lead to higher crime rates,
        so they can make a improvement.
